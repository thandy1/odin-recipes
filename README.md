# Project: Recipes

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website wont look very pretty but its important to mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS. 

## Adding CSS 
For the Block and Inline Assignment for the Foundations course, I will be adding some CSS to my Recipe Project. I will not be focusing on making this look good but applying what ive learned from the TOP curriculum.
